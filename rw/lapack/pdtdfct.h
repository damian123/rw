/**
 * @ingroup factorization_classes
 * @brief Encapsulates factorizations of positive definite symmetric
 * matrices. See also \link RWPDFact RWPDFact<T>\endlink and
 * \link RWPDBandFact RWPDBandFact<T> \endlink
 *
 * The classes \link RWPDFact RWPDFact<T>\endlink, \link RWPDBandFact
 * RWPDBandFact<T>\endlink, and \link RWPDTriDiagFact RWPDTriDiagFact<T>
 * \endlink encapsulate factorizations of positive definite symmetric
 * matrices, which are Hermitians in the complex case. These classes
 * produce a valid factorization only if the matrix being factored
 * is positive definite. If the matrix is \e not positive definite,
 * attempting to use the factorization to solve a system of equations
 * results in an exception being thrown. To test if the factorization
 * is valid, use the good() or fail() member functions.
